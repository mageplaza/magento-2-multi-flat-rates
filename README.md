As a store may want to have more than only one flat rate shipping, **Multiple Flat Rates Shipping** should be in a certain order. Admins can choose this order by sorting every shipping rate on the backend. 

### Multi flat rate visibility

**Each flat rate shipping** can be applied on a restricted number of countries or all allowed countries depending on the settings on backend. 

Admins can multiple select countries to allow buyers in those countries to choose a specific shipping flat rate.

### Error message

Buyers who are not in applicable countries will not be allowed to select that shipping flat rate. In this case, admins can set an error message to inform buyers. This message can be enabled/disabled and changed easily on the backend.
